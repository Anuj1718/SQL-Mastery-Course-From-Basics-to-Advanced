Here are explanations and examples for various date functions in MySQL like `hire_date`, `DATE_FORMAT`, `DATEDIFF`, `EXTRACT`, `MAKEDATE`, and `DATE_ADD`:

### 1. `hire_date`
This refers to a column or field in a table that stores the date an employee was hired. It is typically defined as a `DATE` data type in the table.

Example:

CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_name VARCHAR(100),
    hire_date DATE
);

You can then insert a record with a `hire_date` value like so:

INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, employee_name, hire_date)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', '2020-05-15');


### 2. `DATE_FORMAT`
This function is used to format a date into a specific format.

#### Syntax:

DATE_FORMAT(date, format)
```

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(hire_date, '%Y-%m-%d') AS formatted_hire_date
FROM employees;
```
**Output**: Converts the `hire_date` to a format like `2020-05-15`.

- `%Y`: Year with century (4 digits).
- `%m`: Month (2 digits).
- `%d`: Day of the month (2 digits).

### 3. `DATEDIFF`
This function returns the difference in days between two dates.

#### Syntax:
```sql
DATEDIFF(date1, date2)
```

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT DATEDIFF('2023-01-01', hire_date) AS days_since_hired
FROM employees;
```
**Output**: The number of days between `2023-01-01` and the `hire_date`.

### 4. `EXTRACT`
This function extracts a specific part (like year, month, day) from a date.

#### Syntax:
```sql
EXTRACT(unit FROM date)
```

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM hire_date) AS hire_year,
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM hire_date) AS hire_month
FROM employees;
```
**Output**: Extracts the year and month from the `hire_date`.

- **Unit Options**: `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY`, `HOUR`, `MINUTE`, `SECOND`, etc.

### 5. `MAKEDATE`
This function returns a date from a given year and day of the year.

#### Syntax:
```sql
MAKEDATE(year, day)
```

#### Example:

SELECT MAKEDATE(2023, 150) AS made_date;
```
**Output**: Returns `2023-05-30`, which is the 150th day of the year 2023.

### 6. `DATE_ADD`
This function is used to add a time interval (like days, months, etc.) to a date.

#### Syntax:

DATE_ADD(date, INTERVAL value unit)
```

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT DATE_ADD(hire_date, INTERVAL 10 YEAR) AS date_after_10_years
FROM employees;
```
**Output**: Adds 10 years to the `hire_date`.

- **Unit Options**: `DAY`, `MONTH`, `YEAR`, `HOUR`, `MINUTE`, etc.

### Combined Example:


SELECT 
    employee_name,
    hire_date,
    DATE_FORMAT(hire_date, '%Y-%m-%d') AS formatted_hire_date,
    DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), hire_date) AS days_since_hired,
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM hire_date) AS hire_year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM hire_date) AS hire_month,
    MAKEDATE(2023, 100) AS made_date,
    DATE_ADD(hire_date, INTERVAL 5 YEAR) AS date_after_5_years
FROM employees;
```

**Output**:
- `formatted_hire_date`: Hire date formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- `days_since_hired`: The number of days since the `hire_date`.
- `hire_year` and `hire_month`: Extracted year and month from the `hire_date`.
- `made_date`: The 100th day of the year 2023.
- `date_after_5_years`: The date 5 years after the `hire_date`.


In MySQL, both `TIMESTAMPDIFF()` and `DATEDIFF()` are used to calculate the difference between two dates or date-time values. However, they serve slightly different purposes.

### 1. **`TIMESTAMPDIFF()` Function:**

The `TIMESTAMPDIFF()` function is used to calculate the difference between two date or date-time values, and it returns the result in the specified unit (such as year, month, day, hour, minute, second).

#### Syntax:

TIMESTAMPDIFF(unit, datetime1, datetime2)
```

- **`unit`**: This specifies the unit of measurement for the result (such as `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY`, `HOUR`, `MINUTE`, `SECOND`, etc.).
- **`datetime1`**: The first date or datetime value.
- **`datetime2`**: The second date or datetime value.

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, '2020-01-01', '2025-01-01');
```
- This will return `5`, because there is a 5-year difference between the two dates.

#### Units available for `unit`:
- `YEAR`: Returns the difference in years.
- `MONTH`: Returns the difference in months.
- `DAY`: Returns the difference in days.
- `HOUR`: Returns the difference in hours.
- `MINUTE`: Returns the difference in minutes.
- `SECOND`: Returns the difference in seconds.

#### Example (in months):
```sql
SELECT TIMESTAMPDIFF(MONTH, '2020-01-01', '2025-01-01');
```
This will return `60` months (5 years Ã— 12 months).

### 2. **`DATEDIFF()` Function:**

The `DATEDIFF()` function is used to calculate the number of days between two dates. It returns the difference as an integer representing the number of days.

#### Syntax:
```sql
DATEDIFF(date1, date2)
```

- **`date1`**: The first date.
- **`date2`**: The second date.

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT DATEDIFF('2025-01-01', '2020-01-01');
```
- This will return `1826`, which is the number of days between the two dates.

The result is simply the difference in days, and it does not take into account months or years directly.

### Key Differences:
- `TIMESTAMPDIFF()` allows you to specify the unit (such as years, months, or days) in which you want to measure the difference between two dates.
- `DATEDIFF()` only measures the difference in **days** between two dates.
  
### Use Cases:
- **`TIMESTAMPDIFF()`** is ideal when you need the difference in a specific unit like years, months, or even hours.
- **`DATEDIFF()`** is useful when you simply need the number of days between two dates.

### Example with Both Functions:
If we calculate the difference between '2020-01-01' and '2025-01-01':

- `TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, '2020-01-01', '2025-01-01')` will return `5` years.
- `DATEDIFF('2025-01-01', '2020-01-01')` will return `1826` days.
